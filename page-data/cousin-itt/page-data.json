It&#8217;s dark red. It wants to be a blob.  I call it &#8220;Cousin Itt&#8221; and you should have seen it when I first got here.  It was a horribly tangled mass of dead sticks and hair (those little leaves and twigs that sprout right out of branches &#8211; I call that &#8220;hair&#8221;).  I have been pruning away at this plant for three years now, and today I went at it again.  This post documents a more or less typical pruning experience for me most of the time.  It happens three or four times a year.</p>\n<p>Japanese Maple Pruning Sensei says &#8220;a bird should be able to fly through it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Uhh, nerp.  This is what it looked like when we first moved in, September 2014. The dogwood is visible up and to the right.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_82\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-82\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-82 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1827-e1508966159248-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1827-e1508966159248.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_1827-e1508966159248-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-82\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cousin Itt.

You can&#8217;t see the branch structure because of all the hair. A bird cannot fly through this. Not even a hummingbird!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-81\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2455-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2455.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2455-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2455-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So the first thing to do is just pull all these little twigs and leafies that are sprouting from larger interior branches.  I keep my pruners in my pocket but mostly I don&#8217;t need to use them.</p>\n<p>Before (well actually, I had made a few edits already):</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-84\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2456-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2456.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2456-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2456-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After, although this is a different angle.  Thanks Mr. Sun for the nice lighting effects!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-85\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2457-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2457.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2457-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2457-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the tiers, since I&#8217;ve already decided <em>where</em> the tiers are (that got established the first time I pruned it, more or less), all I need to do is identify individual branches/shoots that originate in any given tier and descend down past their tier into the next one, and prune or remove them.  Or if it&#8217;s a lowest tier, those that touch the ground get pruned.  Depending on what&#8217;s going on, I might prune it part way or all the way.</p>\n<p>The other thing these maples do is what I think of as &#8220;redundancy.&#8221; That&#8217;s when, say, it already has what I think is an adequate amount of growth in an area, and then it makes three new branchlets right in the same area, often going the same direction, right on top or underneath what&#8217;s already there.  In these situations I prune pretty carefully because hey! the new stuff might actually be more desirable than the original stuff.</p>\n<p>Just like in painting you have to step back and look at your work from a distance, and frequently.  Nevermind the maple for a sec, just check out my neighbor&#8217;s Liriodendron! I like how the dogwood looks in front of it.  Fall colors have been spectacular this year, haven&#8217;t they?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-86 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2461-e1508968173963-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2461-e1508968173963.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2461-e1508968173963-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Oh look, right at the bottom of this picture just to the right of the dogwood&#8217;s trunk you can *just* see the top of a little Cupressus glabra &#8216;Sulphurea&#8217; I recently picked up from <a href=\"http://www.xeraplants.com/Xeraplants.com/Xeraplants.com_1.html\">Xera Plants</a> which is a very dangerously short drive from me.  I&#8217;ve been looking for something with either chartreuse or silver/blue foliage to plant right next to this maple and sort of mess with it a little, break it out of its blobbiness.  This awesome cypress has both of those colors! I don&#8217;t know if this plan will work, or it&#8217;ll just make it harder to prune the maple, but I&#8217;m gonna try it.</p>\n<p>Ok here we go, I think I am done:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_87\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-87\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-87 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2469-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2469.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2469-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2469-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-87\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A pruned maple and end-of-season pepper mess</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>See all the other plants in pots? Not counting the gerberas down in front (they always live in pots), there are actually 8 in this photo, all of which will go in the ground this week.  That&#8217;s about 1/4 of the total I have collected in the last couple months &#8211; and that is what I mean by a dangerously short drive.  And now you also see what the grass has been replaced with, at least currently.  There are two rectangular 4 x 10&#8242; beds here that I use for vegetables.  The bed to the left of the maple (we are looking east here) is the sunniest spot on the property so it&#8217;s really great for peppers and eggplants although I might do watermelon here next year, because it&#8217;s pretty.  And silvery.</p>\n<p>And just so you don&#8217;t have to scroll back up:</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-88\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maplebeforeafter-1024x447.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maplebeforeafter.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maplebeforeafter-300x131.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maplebeforeafter-768x335.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s getting there.  The branch structure isn&#8217;t great on this one, but all of that was before my time.  I like thinking of this as an ongoing sculpture collaboration with the tree.  And I think a sparrow could certainly get through there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"October 25, 2017","categories":[{"name":"Trees","slug":"trees"}],"tags":null,"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"79a55e7e-15c4-5e60-a9cf-b64b26124a1a"}}}
