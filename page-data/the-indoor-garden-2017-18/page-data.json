But that posed a problem I hadn&#8217;t anticipated: heat.  WAY too much heat! Because it&#8217;s a closet-type space, there was nothing I could do to bring the heat down &#8211; there just wasn&#8217;t enough air circulation capacity even with a fan.  Terrible for things like spinach and fennel, although fine for Solanaceae members such as peppers, tomatoes, eggplants.</p>\n<p>I thought about this long and hard and finally decided that the best course of action would be to move the T-5 into my office, which is one of the three bedrooms in our house.  I did that, and then put the regular shop light fluorescents back into the laundry area; they won&#8217;t be needed until I start next year&#8217;s crop of veg babies anyway. It&#8217;s easier for me to add heat than to take it away, in that location.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s what the office looks like right now.  In addition to the T-5, I have one red/blue LED lamp over in the corner for my citrus.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-105 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24921-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24921.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24921-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24921-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The chair belongs to my cats.  When I&#8217;m writing these blog posts, this is what is behind me; my computer desk is on the other side of this room.  The room has an east window and gets some actual sunlight in the mornings (if there&#8217;s sun).  It&#8217;s also the coldest room in my house. But the T-5 might change that&#8230;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-106 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24941-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24941.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24941-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24941-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Actual closet plants.  Two of these are plants I&#8217;m overwintering for a friend who has less indoor space.  Those are the Hibiscus schizopetalus (middle back, single-stem thing leaning leftward) and the Strelitzia reginae which is lower right here.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-107 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24951-e1509076621527-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24951-e1509076621527.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24951-e1509076621527-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>Above is a terrible picture of my very favorie plant: Citrus hystrix. I got this almost 10 years ago from Four Winds Growers.  It&#8217;s been a wild ride ever since, but this plant is a real trooper and it&#8217;s the very first year it has produced fruit to maturity! I&#8217;m so excited about that I even got a close-up of just the fruits, with all their knobbiness:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_108\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-108\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-108 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242-150x150.jpg 150w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242-300x300.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242-768x768.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24961-e1509076786242-440x440.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-108\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Citrus hystrix, three fruits here</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the Meyer lemon I received only a couple months ago, also from Four Winds.  It is not looking good.  My friend Paul thought this was a case of &#8220;hothouse shock&#8221; (I think?), which is when something is grown in really ideal conditions and then gets exposed to more variable conditions and croaks.  I believe it &#8212; it looked great when it arrived, but despite all my efforts it has been steadily dropping leaves and declining ever since.  If it dies, this will be the THIRD Meyer lemon I&#8217;ll have killed.  Ugh.  I&#8217;m about ready to give up.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-109 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906-150x150.jpg 150w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906-300x300.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906-768x768.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24971-e1509077000906-440x440.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m happy about this.  This is a pepper that I started from seed bought from Territorial Seed Company, out of Eugene area, where I tend to buy all my vegetable seeds.  It&#8217;s a mild pepper, no heat actually, variety name is &#8220;Yum Yum Gold&#8221; and it was a great plant that seemed like the right one to bring in.  I dug it up, washed the native soil off its roots as much as I could, potted it up into Sunshine mix #4, removed all its fruits (there were a LOT!) and here it is a month later, looking awesome.  I&#8217;m trying to learn how best to overwinter Capsicum because I want to get good at it with the C. chinense super-hot varieties.  They take longer to mature so overwintering seems likely to be advantageous.. Anyway, this is an experiment with this C. annuum cultivar.  We shall see.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-110 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-150x150.jpg 150w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-300x300.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-768x768.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24981-e1509077052424-440x440.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, for this post, here&#8217;s a little update on the Saintpaulia that was featured in my very first post on this blog.  It&#8217;s doing great! Not wilty anymore, and I couldn&#8217;t photograph it so you have to take my word on this, but it has already sprouted a couple of little roots off the crown.  Ahhhh&#8230;</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-111\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24991-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24991.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24991-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_24991-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.  See you soon!</p>\n","date":"October 27, 2017","categories":[{"name":"houseplants","slug":"houseplants"},{"name":"Overwintering","slug":"overwintering"}],"tags":null,"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"43528dac-59da-52dc-8d8f-d73a5ece014b"}}}
