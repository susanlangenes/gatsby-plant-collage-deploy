I didn&#8217;t explicitly photograph it but I think it should move as well &#8211; its luscious black flowers are completely dessicated.  The Phormium is fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Santolina &#8216;Lemon Fizz&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9620.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-832\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9620.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9620-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9620-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ouch, this poor Santolina has really taken a beating.  I am not 100% sure I&#8217;m going to move it, but at the very least I need to see if a mole has tunneled under it.  Here&#8217;s my other one, which receives basically no water: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9641.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-833\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9641.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9641-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9641-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Happy Santolina &#8216;Lemon Fizz&#8217;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I rather like the profusion of brown puffballs, something is definitely up with that first one and I need to help it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Agastache &#8216;Apricot Sunset&#8217;</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9624.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-834\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9624.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9624-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Agastache &#8216;Apricot Sunset&#8217; &#8211; sorry this is a terrible photo but you get the idea; the Agastache is wilting and the Phygelius isn&#8217;t.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At least I *think* it&#8217;s &#8216;Apricot Sunset&#8217;.  I got it at Portland Nursery and planted it at the same time as the two Phygelius you see behind it. They don&#8217;t care at all about water! The Agastache will move to the backyard where there are two others and they can all be a mass of  sunset colors together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This bigass Cynara</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9626.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-835\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9626.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9626-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>It was some interesting Italian cultivar and I&#8217;ve lost the tag long ago</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This spectacular artichoke has given us its grand finale this year! Pups may arise and if they do, I may or may not keep them.  I&#8217;ve enjoyed its huge silvery leaves for the last three years, and the bees go crazy for the flowers, but I&#8217;m ready for a change.  This isn&#8217;t really about no-water, it&#8217;s more about the plant just running the normal course of its life. And I want that Perovskia to be less floppy, which it&#8217;ll have an easier time doing if there isn&#8217;t a giant thistle immediately to the south of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lysimachia clethroides</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9630.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-836\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9630.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9630-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Major fail</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My neighbor has a big stand of Lysimachia clethroides which she doesn&#8217;t water AT ALL and it looks just like this!

I don&#8217;t even like this plant, I don&#8217;t know why I have it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Echinacea purpurea</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9632.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-837\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9632.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9632-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Echinacea is NOT drought-tolerant, no matter what the ENTIRE DAMN INTERNET tells you</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Do a google search right now for &#8220;Echinacea drought-tolerant&#8221; and every last flipping search result will assert that &#8220;Echinacea is blissfully drought-tolerant&#8221; or some such.  FALSE.  This thing is also a slug magnet.  So she gets to relocate to the back yard! Maybe with all those Agastaches. <br/></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Imperata cylindrica</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9637.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-838\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9637.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9637-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9637-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>HA Hahahaaaa what was I thinking</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I KNEW I&#8217;d have to water this grass but I planted it in several places here anyway, stupidly creating more work for myself because now I have to move it.  To someone else&#8217;s garden.  It can&#8217;t go in the back because the ducks will eat it.  It looks SO bad right now! I&#8217;ll water it from now on and it&#8217;ll be better by the time fall comes and I dig it up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stachyurus salicifolius</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9634.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-839\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9634.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9634-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9634-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This lovely thing really does need more water than I am willing to drag out to this farthest-from-the-hose part of the yard.  I will move it this fall. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Winners!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok now for the ones that passed the test. Not everyone got an A+ but I&#8217;d say anything in the B range or better is a pass. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Epilobium/Zauschneria</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9607.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-840\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9607.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9607-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9607-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I have &#8216;Bowman&#8217; (pictured) and &#8216;Silver Select&#8217; in here, along with some Sedum sediforme ‘Spanish Selection’ &#8211; All from <a href=\"https://xeraplants.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xera Plants</a>. The sedum does look dry, but I give them all an A+ along with the Zauschnerias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I planted these last fall, and they have not had a single drop of water that didn&#8217;t come from the sky.  They are also 4-5x the size they were at planting.  We better get some more Zauschneria cultivars out there cause everybody should be planting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Agave parryi var. truncata<br/></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9612.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-841\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9612.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9612-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9612-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>A no-brainer.<br/></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I planted this in May after purchasing it from <a href=\"https://www.pomariusnursery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomarius Nursery</a> last fall and keeping it in a pot under shelter all winter/spring. Took me that long to decide where, and then I spaded in a fair amount of pumice (from Concentrates, about $5/bag) and made something of a berm for it and a few other desert plants. Hopefully that&#8217;ll keep them from being waterlogged in the winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Origanum x ‘Bristol Cross’</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9614.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-842\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9614.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9614-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9614-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I purchased this plant at <a href=\"http://concentratesnw.com/v2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Concentrates</a> in 2015 and it has performed really, really well in this partly sunny spot (hot afternoon sun, mostly) just inside the canopy of my dogwood tree here. I watered it consistently last summer and very little this summer &#8211; just one good watering in June. It&#8217;s a little dry-looking but it&#8217;s blooming its heart out anyway. A- for looking quite decent, if not flipping amazing, even with moles and thirsty dogwood roots to contend with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gaura/Oenothera lindheimeri</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9617.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-843\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9617.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9617-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The unphotographable Gaura is the absolute rockstar of my front yard &#8211; they&#8217;re wild and weird and they haven&#8217;t a care in the world.  I might try giving them a haircut just to see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lavender</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9618.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-844\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9618.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9618-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9618-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Duh.

Love.  This was the first of three that I have planted (the other two are in the backyard).  I could see three or five more&#8230; </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geranium harveyi</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9631.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-849\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9631.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9631-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9631-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. I am impressed.  After a bit of a rough start, this South African hardy Geranium (to low 20&#8217;s, according to Annie&#8217;s Annuals where I got it mail-order) has really taken off &#8211; it lost almost all of its leaves for a while because this is a rough area that is hard for me to water (hose isn&#8217;t long enough, soil is hard clay, blah blah blah). I planted it in April I think, and it took it a couple months to get established but now it looks great and I have high hopes.  I will mulch it well this winter and protect it with whatever I can if I have to.  Other sources say it&#8217;s hardier and I would love input on that if anyone has experience with it.  I&#8217;m a sucker for silver. And purple (flowers). And Geraniums in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Symphoricarpos (Snowberry)</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-850\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9640-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>this is not a great photo, but at least you can see the plant is green and lush</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My last winner is our locally native snowberry.  I got these at the Friends of Tryon Creek native plant sale in late winter of 2015 and decided to test them out here under the thirsty dogwood tree in almost full shade.  They are doing fantastic there.  I love these leaves, the plant form, and those snow-white berries in the fall/winter.  You can see them forming here if you look close. In the right setting I personally think snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus and/or other western species) can be a very good garden plant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are of course multiple others that I could show you, but with the selections presented I hope you get the idea that a bit of a shift is upcoming as I move toward a more sustainable and lower-input garden in the front yard.  I find myself much more excited about the plants that can thrive on their own with little or no input (read: water) from me, and there is a definite sense of accomplishment and delight with a garden that is aesthetically pleasing, botanically interesting, and also ecologically sound and sustainable.  It&#8217;s not all about laziness 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one last thing! I wrote this entire post using the new Gutenberg editor from WordPress &#8211; first time for me.  After a brief learning curve at the start (new icons, things in different places, etc) I have to say I LOVE it.  It feels faster and easier and smoother and just all-around better than the old WYSIWYG editor which I&#8217;ve been using for many years. Good job, Automattic.  There is room for improvement in small ways, but so far, I think it&#8217;s fantastic! </p>\n","date":"August 26, 2018","categories":[{"name":"Front yard","slug":"front-yard"}],"tags":[{"name":"Agastache","slug":"agastache"},{"name":"Agave","slug":"agave"},{"name":"Arctostaphylos","slug":"arctostaphylos"},{"name":"Artichoke","slug":"artichoke"},{"name":"Cynara","slug":"cynara"},{"name":"Echinacea","slug":"echinacea"},{"name":"Eupatorium","slug":"eupatorium"},{"name":"Gaura","slug":"gaura"},{"name":"Geranium","slug":"geranium"},{"name":"Imperata","slug":"imperata"},{"name":"Lavender","slug":"lavender"},{"name":"Lysimachia","slug":"lysimachia"},{"name":"Oenothera","slug":"oenothera"},{"name":"Origanum","slug":"origanum"},{"name":"Ozothamnus","slug":"ozothamnus"},{"name":"Santolina","slug":"santolina"},{"name":"Stachyurus","slug":"stachyurus"},{"name":"Symphoricarpos","slug":"symphoricarpos"},{"name":"Veronica","slug":"veronica"},{"name":"Zauschneria","slug":"zauschneria"}],"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b558d517-5acf-5567-884c-25a333ef5db3"}}}
