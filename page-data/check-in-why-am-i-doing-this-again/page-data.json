And native plants, grow all the natives!!!1!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Four years ago:</em> I&#8217;m not really sure I want to grow kiwis.  Tomatoes are not very pretty plants.  Oh well, have to grow em.  Watering is hard; maybe I&#8217;ll set up rainwater catchment.  Wow Rosa nutkana is 12&#8242; tall already.  Hm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Three years ago:</em> Jesus CHRIST this is a hell of a lot of work.  I do NOT want to have to build a kiwi arbor.  It&#8217;s hot out here.  I need to plant some shade trees and I do not need any more pears. Damn, rainwater catchment really does <em>not</em> work in a dry summer climate unless you have 18,0000,00000 gallons of water storage volume.  How little can I water the tomatoes? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Two years ago:</em>  Oh heyyyyy xeriscaping (bats eyelashes).  God it&#8217;s hot out here.  Ima plant me some more trees.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Last year:</em> I want nothing but manzanitas, weird Australian shrubbery, anything silvery, and everything also must have microscopic leaves.  Oh and if there are flowers in peach/orange/pink tones, bring it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Also last year: </em>I finally came to a realization that cannot stand all the rectangular garden beds (not really raised; more like edged with wood) that I&#8217;d built in years prior.  I hated the right angle turns I was constantly making.  I hated wrestling with the hose around corners and too-narrow paths.  And I started to not like the extremely variable overall form of the garden &#8211; tall plants over here one year, over there the next; vines here then there&#8230; I was craving more consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical raised beds with wide paths all perfectly graveled, vegetables growing way up off the ground and nowhere near native soil is NOT the direction I wanted to go. I have GREAT soil &#8211; it is deficient in nothing and beautifully textured Latourell loam.  So ixnay on the idea of wider paths and taller beds; though that would certainly help with the hose struggle, I just don&#8217;t want to garden that way.  What I really want is curving paths and organic shapes for beds; foliar screens and room dividers; deliberate and artistic contrasts in texture and form.  Not ready to completely rip everything out and start from scratch, I set about removing all the 2&#215;6 cedar edges as beds which I had been growing vegetables became available over the course of the season. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paths have started to form; I&#8217;ve lined some with bricks and others with old hoses, which I prefer, but old hoses are in limited quantity while bricks are abundant.  I started thinking even more in terms of water-use zones, and considered automatic irrigation in some key areas.  At this point I have given up at least half of the space that was formerly allocated to vegetable gardening and I&#8217;m preparing to lose even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"new garden path marked by hoses\" class=\"wp-image-900\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4629-e1558214100598-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Look, hoses AND bricks here</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As one who sees herself as an avid vegetable grower, this is a big and somewhat challenging adjustment.  I never thought I&#8217;d be one of <em>those</em> gardeners who says, &#8220;yeah, I used to grow tomatoes&#8230;.&#8221; But here I am. Priorities change and I guess gardens change along with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, lest you think I&#8217;m done yet, I assure you I am not.  Under these lovely (ahem) covered wagons are a dozen tomatoes (most grafted), about 40 peppers and a whole bunch of melons of various types.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-901\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4630-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Irony. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s totally ironic that I&#8217;ve always disliked that white shed roof, and I&#8217;ve been pretty vocal in my complaints about it, but then I go and make all these ugly-ass hoop houses.  Do I really want to look at this?  The honest truth is that no, I don&#8217;t. But I still love growing the plants that are under them, and I&#8217;m not yet ready to say this is the last time I&#8217;ll do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of, and in the midst of all that, as of April I have a new housemate. I want to incorporate her ideas about gardening and what she wants to grow, and perhaps satisfy her ideas about aesthetics as well, even when they differ from mine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all potentially a lot of pretty quick change for me, and I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that I can take a long time to adjust to change, especially the type that feels like it reshapes my trajectory, I guess because clear trajectory feels hard for me to come by in the first place! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I DID manage a project along the lines of a trajectory that I&#8217;d already started playing with in the front yard: a dry garden area; in this case a bit of a berm.  This was where I grew tomatoes last year:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"ducks help dig a new garden bed\" class=\"wp-image-902\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4499-e1558214906346-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Debug team is helping.  So helpful.  And housemate&#8217;s foot (she IS helpful for real!).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We raked the wood chips off, broke up the clods, and into that went about 5 bags of pumice (1 cu. ft. each). These bags are about $5 each from Concentrates which is right down the road from me.  Easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"plant placement in garden\" class=\"wp-image-903\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4501-e1558214863832-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Almost all are treasures from plant swaps and friends</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t look very berm-y in the above photo, but the next one might give a better idea.  I had amassed quite a collection of plants that like things on the dry side and love good drainage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4503-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"ducks in new garden bed\" class=\"wp-image-904\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4503.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4503-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4503-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Almost done.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4632-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-905\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4632.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4632-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4632-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Another view, two weeks later.  Lots of new growth on Bulbine frutescens (the green thing this side of the poppies). </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It really doesn&#8217;t look like much, but such is the nature of new plantings. I don&#8217;t love the look of the pumice but I&#8217;m willing to put up with it while I figure out a mulch; I&#8217;m not ready to commit to gravel so it&#8217;s probably wood chips or nothing.  I&#8217;ve added some bits of fencing and a big pot shard to protect little plants from the ravages of dogs and hoses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the ravages of dogs, do you have ANY idea how hard it is to establish new shrubs when you have two large-to-giant male dogs who get into pee wars? The damage is very real. After four or five outright deaths, I&#8217;m <em>finally </em>coming to grips with having to just fence around plants.  I&#8217;ve been reluctant in the past because if I fence off one plant, the focus will simply shift to another.  While that is true, it is also true that some plants can take more pee than others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I finally did this, in addition to multiple other fences around individual plants:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"garden fence to keep dogs out\" class=\"wp-image-906\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4631-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Fenced off are a young Eucryphia (among native blackcaps) and a couple of Carpenterias. Yes those are potatoes from 2 years ago at front right.  Shut up.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I know, it&#8217;s gross and it seems silly; why even let your dogs back there at all, you may wonder.  I&#8217;ll tell you: I want to have my cake and eat it too in getting these shrubs established, while allowing the dogs their backyard pee breaks since apparently it&#8217;s too hard to take them on walks out front so they can pee on the neighbors&#8217; shrubbery.   Besides, even if we made that a habit, these dudes would <em>still</em> have to mark, and mark on top, and on top, ad nauseam.  Even just marking, when the dogs are 70lbs and 100lbs, is significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. I&#8217;ll conclude with a list of what I put in that new bed, and a photo of my favorite of all of them.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Two Agaves maybe salmiana or havardiana</li><li>Three Sphaeralcea &#8216;Newleaze Coral&#8217;</li><li>Three Anaphalis margaritacea </li><li>Bulbine frutescens</li><li>Sinningia tubiflora</li><li>Hesperaloe parviflora</li><li>Eryngium &#8216;Neptune&#8217;s Gold&#8217;</li><li>Penstemon pinifolius</li><li>Dasylirion wheeleri from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Cistus (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"http://cistus.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cistus</a>, couldn&#8217;t resist it at Hortlandia</li><li>Callistemon pallidus &#8216;Eleanor&#8217; from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The Desert Northwest (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.desertnorthwest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Desert Northwest</a> (also a Hortlandia purchase)</li><li>Aquilegia chrysantha var chaplinii from <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Xera Plants (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://xeraplants.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xera Plants</a> &#8211; really cool blue-purple foliage, this one is from New Mexico/Texas.</li><li>Arctostaphylos pumila &#8216;Gray Form&#8217; also from Xera.  </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to my crazy fun gardening friends for the unsourced plants listed above, and to our stalwart local nurseries as well.  These are all plants I could look at for days, months, years.  And yes, I&#8217;ve answered my own question, haven&#8217;t I? THIS is why I am doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sigh&#8230; here&#8217;s my favorite, the Arctostaphylos pumila naturally.  I didn&#8217;t get a great photo so you&#8217;ll just have to trust me that this plant is incredibly charming and very, very pretty.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4633-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-907\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4633.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4633-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_4633-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> This.
