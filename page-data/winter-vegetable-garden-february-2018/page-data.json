With more of an actual head? This is how it seems to me anyway, compared to regular purple sprouting broccoli which really doesn&#8217;t make a central head at all.  These plants are flipping beautiful, too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-281 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4259-e1517531867617-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4259-e1517531867617.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4259-e1517531867617-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_293\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-293\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-293 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4462-e1517532068119-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4462-e1517532068119.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4462-e1517532068119-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-293\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">yeah, this is the same plant as the first picture above.

The variety here is &#8216;January King.&#8217;  This is my favorite winter cabbage variety &#8211; if I had to grow just one, it&#8217;d be this one.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-282 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4410-e1517531893559-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4410-e1517531893559.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4410-e1517531893559-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure, but this may be &#8216;January King&#8217; as well. But this one doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to head up.  I always think that when they&#8217;re at this stage, and usually they prove me wrong.  We&#8217;ll see.  It looks like ornamental kale, kind of, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-292\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4460-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4460.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4460-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4460-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are some other cabbages &#8211; these came from an overwintering cabbage blend from Territorial.  So who knows what the actual varieties are.  I don&#8217;t really care; they change what&#8217;s in their blends every year anyway.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-283\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4411-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4411.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4411-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4411-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>See all the evidence of something eating the lower/older leaves on these?  All these Brassicaceae family plants have that to some degree or other.  It&#8217;s about half slugs and half birds.  Earlier in the fall, before the ducks were coming over to this side of the garden, the slugs and probably cutworms were having their way.  I&#8217;m happy to report that I have done absolutely nothing I mean NOTHING to combat slugs and cutworms this year.  The ducks eat them all!</p>\n<p>This next one is a crappy picture, sorry! But this shows the cabbage on the far right in the above photo.  You can see that it&#8217;s heading up very nicely and should be ready later this month.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-291 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4459-e1517532044215-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4459-e1517532044215.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4459-e1517532044215-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I just harvested three plants&#8217; worth of Brussels sprouts. I thought this one could go a bit longer so I left it. Again this is from one of those winter season mixes from Territorial.  Nordic Winter Blend Hybrid, it says.  Three different varieties apparently.  So maybe those others were earlier-maturing.</p>\n<p>I have to put a plug here for growing these Brussels sprouts over the winter.  You might find yourself hosing off aphids a couple times in September, but then once the cool weather hits, the aphids split town and you&#8217;re golden.  It&#8217;s a million times easier to grow all these Brassicas in the cool season, I find.  If you haven&#8217;t done it, I encourage you to try next year.  Get varieties bred for the cool season, or for overwintering, sow your seed indoors in mid-June, and set plants out in August.  Watch &#8217;em for aphids and spray with Bt for those cabbage moths.  You&#8217;ll only have to do that until the cool weather of fall comes.  They don&#8217;t need any protection from freezes, I promise.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-284 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4416-e1517531914646-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4416-e1517531914646.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4416-e1517531914646-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my helper Ramona, digging slugs and worms out from under the 2&#8243; layer of wood chip mulch in there.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-285 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4423-e1517531937490-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4423-e1517531937490.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4423-e1517531937490-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>These plants are tall enough that she can easily walk under and among them and keep everything tidy.  Sure, she nibbles a leaf now and then, but mostly the ducks are after insects.  I feed them grain every day, too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-286\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4439-576x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4439.png 576w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4439-169x300.png 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These next plants are the cauliflower.  In this pic, the large plants in back are the ones I&#8217;ve been calling my &#8220;ornamental cauliflower&#8221;  &#8212; they were started from seed in July of 2016.  Yes, 2016 and that is not a typo.  They just didn&#8217;t flower &#8211; not in the summer, not in the winter, not in the spring&#8230; I think it&#8217;s just a combination of a lot of factors that prevented whatever triggers their flowering process.  Compare their size to the plants in front, which were started in June 2017.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-290 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4458-e1517532012580-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4458-e1517532012580.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4458-e1517532012580-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And it turns out, one of them is actually a broccoli!

The ducks roost at night in the coop with the chickens, and when I let all of them out in the mornings, the ducks fly over the 5&#8242; fence out of the chicken run and into the garden, where they hang out all day until I let them go back and roost at night.  They&#8217;re not super accurate fliers, so a smashed garlic plant on occasion is just part of the deal.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-298\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_44721-e1517539563937-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_44721-e1517539563937.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_44721-e1517539563937-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next week I&#8217;ll be starting my tomatoes indoors.  This year, I&#8217;m trying a completely new-to-me thing with them: grafting!
