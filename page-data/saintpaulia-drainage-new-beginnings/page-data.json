I’ve had various forms of blogs over the years, but nothing really for serious. Now I feel like I’m going to get serious, and I have been thinking for days about what my first post should be.</p>\n<p>A before and after of my house? Well, the <em>after</em> isn’t all that great right now. But you love works in progress, right? I&#8217;ll definitely do some of this sort of thing.  An explanation of my experiences of gardening in my new to me house that I’ve lived in for three years? That&#8217;ll happen too, perhaps next post.</p>\n<p>Tonight I was in my office room, and I decided to do something about an ailing Saintpaulia.  Earlier today in Facebook land, we had some great conversations about drainage &#8211; I was worrying about Manzanitas, Australian plants, and various others I&#8217;ve collected this summer and now need to put in the ground. And then here’s this little plant. It&#8217;s just an Orange Box Special (I rarely buy plants there but one day several months ago this one followed me home. It has been flowering for me quite regularly and even now, and its current state of distress.</p>\n<p>But I want to explain to you why the Saintpaulia is important. As an introduction to me and my garden blog, I think it’s appropriate to explain that the very first plant that got me into gardening was of all things Saintpaulia.</p>\n<p>When I was a kid, somehow I got entranced with them. I tried so hard to grow them, but the house that we lived in had wood stove heat and very bad light. You can imagine how that combination of very dismal humidity, rapidly changing temperatures, and crap light made it very difficult to grow these things.  I&#8217;ve since almost never been without one.  I&#8217;ve killed many, propagated many, but I would never consider myself any kind of expert with them.  I just like &#8217;em, which is weird because I don&#8217;t really like anything else in that plant family.</p>\n<p>Anyway here she is, this evening.  In this pic I have removed the plant from the pot it was in.  I suspect poor drainage and maybe overwatering caused crown rot.  Look at these droopy leaves.  Major drought stress.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-14 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/image1-768x576.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>I started to prick away at the root mass with my handy chopstick.
