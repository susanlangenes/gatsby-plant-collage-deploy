It&#8217;s about my sanity, it&#8217;s about botanical experiments, and it&#8217;s very much about the immense joy that David and I get out of eating seasonally, preserving, and having our meals dictated at least in some part by what is available to eat in the garden on any given day.</p>\n<p>All that said, my own focus in gardening has definitely shifted from &#8220;food forest.&#8221; I still want to grow things we can eat, but not <em>only</em> edibles.  In 2015 we established two 4&#8242; x 10&#8242; vegetable gardening beds in the front yard, in areas that were previously lawn grass.  We edged them with 2&#215;6 cedar as we did with the 9 similar beds we have in the back.  Mind you these are not, for the most part, raised beds.  I&#8217;d call them &#8220;edged beds&#8221; because most of them aren&#8217;t raised at all &#8211; the cedar edging merely helps to keep grass and clover out.   It works.</p>\n<p>This year I decided to convert one of the beds in the front from an edged edible garden bed to an ornamental bed.  A lot went into that, and now I want to show the whole entire process.</p>\n<p>In August 2015, we began by making these two &#8220;edged&#8221; beds:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_725\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-725\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-725 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_0381-e1529859632203-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">After this picture was taken, we sunk the 2x6s down a bit</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The first year we planted brassicas and leeks.

I get my potting soil, fertilizer, and bird food there too.  I love Concentrates!</p>\n<p>First, though, a detour: directly under the Nothofagus, I threw down some Angelina sedum when I planted the tree, and I want this area to evolve and for plants to shift around a bit.  So far, I have this combination which is a bit of an ode to Evan Bean of <a href=\"http://practicalplantgeek.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Practical Plant Geek</a>:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_739\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-739\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-739\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7921-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7921.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7921-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_7921-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-739\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Papaver nudicaule, Angelina sedum, Plantago major &#8216;Rubrifolia&#8217;, and Cerinthe major.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I planted 6 Plantago major &#8216;Rubrifolia&#8217; around here and I love them.  They are a wonderful contrast to the sedum and the bright orange poppy.  Evan grew the Plantago from seed, and I grew the poppy and the Cerinthe from seed (found Cerinthe seeds at Garden Fever).  I also blame Evan for the poppy because the inspiration to grow them was sparked by a conversation with him about poppies back in March.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, I also sowed (whyyy?) Nicotiana sylvestris and after agonizing about where to put them for a long time, a few ended up here too.  Here is the whole area:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_740\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-740\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-740 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8124-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8124.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8124-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_8124-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Oh, hey, a california poppy ended up in here too.

You can&#8217;t see it well but there&#8217;s a Callistemon viridiflorus in there too, to help satisfy my craving for light yellow/chartreuse next to red.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m doing that with the big red Japanese maple too.  I may change my mind eventually and take it out, but for now, it&#8217;s really helping drive some design decisions.  In fact, that tree dominates the entire front yard and affects almost every decision I make, whether it&#8217;s about foliage color, plant form, or plant placement.  The venerable maple demands to be part of the conversation. For someone new to garden design such as myself, this isn&#8217;t just helpful but necessary.</p>\n<p>This has been a &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;during&#8221; post for this part of the garden, formerly vegetable bed #10, and now it&#8217;s basically two zones &#8211; the immediate surrounds of the Nothofagus, and the desert berm. Hopefully they&#8217;ll mush together a bit as the reseeders migrate around and I&#8217;ll end up with something interesting that relates to the rest of the front yard at least somewhat.  I should probably mulch the berm or add rocks? What would you do? Cram some more plants in there? All these plants are brand-new to me so I&#8217;m very interested in suggestions!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"June 24, 2018","categories":[{"name":"Front yard","slug":"front-yard"},{"name":"Ornamental plants","slug":"ornamental-plants"},{"name":"Succulents","slug":"succulents"}],"tags":[{"name":"Agave","slug":"agave"},{"name":"Cerinthe","slug":"cerinthe"},{"name":"Euphorbia","slug":"euphorbia"},{"name":"Grevillea","slug":"grevillea"},{"name":"Hesperaloe","slug":"hesperaloe"},{"name":"Nothofagus","slug":"nothofagus"},{"name":"Opuntia","slug":"opuntia"},{"name":"Papaver","slug":"papaver"},{"name":"Plantago","slug":"plantago"},{"name":"Stipa","slug":"stipa"}],"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"db9aed08-a457-5e40-acfb-c9e7e194621f"}}}
