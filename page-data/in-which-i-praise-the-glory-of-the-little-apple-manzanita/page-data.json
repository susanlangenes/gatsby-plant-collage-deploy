Actually, I am going to do a little plug right now for one of my favorite local growers/nurseries, Xera Plants.  Several years ago, my friend and co-owner of Xera, Paul Bonine, wrote this great piece for Pacific Horticulture Society: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-pacific-horticulture-society\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"f7RtJ7495C\"><a href=\"https://www.pacifichorticulture.org/articles/arctostaphylos-for-pacific-northwest-gardens/\">Arctostaphylos for Pacific Northwest Gardens</a></blockquote><iframe title=\"&#8220;Arctostaphylos for Pacific Northwest Gardens&#8221; &#8212; Pacific Horticulture Society\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https://www.pacifichorticulture.org/articles/arctostaphylos-for-pacific-northwest-gardens/embed/#?secret=f7RtJ7495C\" data-secret=\"f7RtJ7495C\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul starts his article with the phrase: &#8220;No other shrub is more symbolic of the Pacific Coast than manzanita.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, on his own website (disclaimer: I did the programming for that site but he did all the writing), he calls manzanita &#8220;the ultimate shrub of the west.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot possibly agree more.  Why? Because in a xeric climate, AKA Mediterranean climate, AKA dry-summer climate, AKA totally perverse but also awesome climate in which plants have devised brilliant adaptations to the experience of receiving water from The Gods only when most of them don&#8217;t need it, there really is no better, no more pleasing, no more beautifully lush-year-round plant than the manzanita.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I fail to understand, however, is why they aren&#8217;t more common in gardens.  Actually we were talking about that the other day and all we could surmise is that there are a number of factors: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Relative novelty in the horticultural trade &#8211; they&#8217;re still not *that* easy to find and certainly not at places like Fred Meyer or The Box Stores</li><li>The perception that they&#8217;re hard to grow.  In some cases/species, this may be true</li><li>The need to plant them at a relatively small size (no, you can&#8217;t just go get a 5-gallon and have instant manzanita hedge).  A gardener must exhibit some degree of patience</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-983\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-scaled.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-300x169.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-768x432.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0190-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>An impressive row of 5 big manzanitas in Montavilla</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I counted, and I think I now have a total of 11 manzanitas.  I want to show you the most recent acquisitions and visit a couple of older favorites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should show you the spot, but I don&#8217;t have a stellar picture right now.  For a couple years I have been agonizing about what to plant to fill in a space immediately to the north of my now-12-foot-tall Lyonothamnus; an impressive but not imposing tree which I am totally in love with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That spot to the left (north) of the tree is a Major Focal Point and I have really struggled with what to put there, especially now with the tree casting some shade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After my friend August came over and suggested a big ol&#8217; Nolina (something like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"this, perhaps? (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://plantlust.com/plants/6656/nolina-la-siberica/\" target=\"_blank\">this, perhaps?</a>), I somehow managed to entertain that idea and then come to remember that actually, this is a perfect spot for a larger manzanita.

I finally FINALLY removed the gigantic Salvia &#8216;Hot Lips&#8217; that was right by the front door and committed to something with more year-round interest, but that still gives the hummingbirds what they want.

Right under this manzanita, I planted a beautiful <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Agave ovatifolia 'Frosty Blue'  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://plantlust.com/plants/6365/agave-ovatifolia-frosty-blue/\" target=\"_blank\">Agave ovatifolia &#8216;Frosty Blue&#8217; </a>which was a gift from my friend James in California.   I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased with this duo as a foundation to my front-door vignette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s check on the first manzanita I planted here.   This is an A. x densiflora selection and I can&#8217;t remember if it&#8217;s &#8216;Sentinel&#8217;, &#8216;Harmony&#8217;, or &#8216;Howard McMinn&#8217; but I&#8217;m leaning toward &#8216;Howard McMinn&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-991\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0113-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Can you believe how amazing this looks in November?! </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I am really happy about that plant.  The small, narrow leaves work really well with the texture of the Gaura and lavender near it and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing it eventually dominate this scene a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of dominate, though, I actually planted another thing that will eventually dominate over the manzanita above, possibly to its detriment, but we&#8217;ll see &#8211; this is Arbutus arizonica, another gift from my friend Chris:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-992\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0114-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Arbutus arizonica baby</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This smallish tree has wonderfully blue leaves which are narrower than our native Pacific madrone, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be a little more resistant to Phytophthora, although in this spot it should be just fine because it&#8217;ll never get summer water anyway.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-993\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0115-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Can you  EVEN with the new growth in fall?!

We shall see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple other older manzanitas I planted at the same time as Howard, so, a couple years ago?  This is Arctostaphylos silvicola ‘Ghostly’:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0107-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-994\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0107.jpeg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0107-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0107-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0107-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Leaning a lot because it&#8217;s under the canopy of the dogwood.

I like the lean they&#8217;re exhibiting, and they seem to benefit from the dogwood&#8217;s thirsty roots ensuring that there will be no soil moisture in the summer! Ha.  They&#8217;ve both experienced a bit of mold/fungus on their lowermost leaves, which I attribute to the presence of deciduous leaves at their bases and possibly to being a bit shaded, but mostly, I think it&#8217;s just that they&#8217;re young still and rather close to the ground.  They&#8217;ll grow out of this more or less, I hope. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok that wraps up this week&#8217;s geekout on Arctostaphylos with a side of Arbutus.  Thanks for reading.
