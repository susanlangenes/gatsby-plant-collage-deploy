She didn&#8217;t have room.  I did, it was female, and when it came time for harvest I asked another neighbor if he could help me figure out if it was ready or not (because he grew weed the year before), so he came over with his little weed magnifying glass and we looked at the trichomes with it.</p>\n<p>I have a plant-based story for pretty much every single neighbor.  Even my usual letter carrier! That&#8217;s actually a cool story too: I was digging a vegetable bed in the front yard and he asked, &#8220;Who are you burying?&#8221; After I replied with some suitably outlandish answer, we got to chatting and he asked if we used to live on 13th? Why yes, we did for about 10 years.  He said he was the letter carrier there too! And he changed to this Milwaukie route around the same time we moved here!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not like I would never have met anyone if it wasn&#8217;t for plants.  I just think it&#8217;s very cool that I am connected to all these wonderful people through plants.  It happened back on 13th, too, because of course we did front-yard vegetable gardening there.  Strawberries and cherry tomatoes were gifts to the neighborhood and they loved them.  I miss having a sidewalk &#8211; sidewalks and parking strips make it easier to grow snackable food plants that people can reach.  But I can still send luffas.</p>\n<p>And now, part two, because I feel like it:</p>\n<h3>How to do up a luffa gourd!</h3>\n<p>Directions specific to the Portland area.</p>\n<p>First <a href=\"http://www.territorialseed.com/product/Seven_Happiness_Luffa_Seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get seeds</a>.  Treat them like you would habaneros or watermelons; they need a long growing season and some real heat to produce well. Start indoors really early like February or March if you can.  Set out in May, or if you need to set them out earlier, give them some protection like a hoop house or something.  Passive solar heat exchangers, like jugs of water or bricks/rocks, are also useful I find.  As with all cucurbits, they will need ample water during the growing season.  And they&#8217;ll need something to climb on.</p>\n<p>These guys got sections of tennis net this year.  The bricks are passive solar heat exchangers for when I first set them out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-140 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08841-e1509579045607-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If all goes well, the hope is that the gourds themselves will have time to mature before the vines are killed by a good freeze.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_141\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-141\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-141 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_08851-e1509579178920-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-141\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">These *could* be harvested at this stage, but it&#8217;s better to wait until the skin darkens and gets hard and starts to crack.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>By the way the flowers are really quite pretty:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_139\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-139\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-139 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_07261-e1509579228578-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-139\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Luffa flowers</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>I thought for damn sure I&#8217;d taken at least one picture of the process of skinning and cleaning a properly mature luffa earlier this year but I can&#8217;t for the life of me find it.  So, you get pics instead of how to do it with one that <em>isn&#8217;t </em>mature.  That&#8217;s actually better anyway!
