It&#8217;s because we went in on the order together to save on shipping, and the delivery timing coincided better with a time I&#8217;d be able to receive it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always interesting to see how plants are shipped.  I was impressed with this method!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5017-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"plants in a shipping box\" class=\"wp-image-917\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5017.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5017-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Flowers by the Sea (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https://www.fbts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flowers by the Sea</a> is a mail order nursery specializing in Salvia, a genus that I find particularly interesting, not only for their utility to pollinators, but also because so many are drought-tolerant heat lovers and that&#8217;s a pretty important niche in any west coast garden especially inland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing with the unpacking, under the layer of peanuts there are plants, each in a 4&#8243; pot, very carefully wrapped in 2-3 sheets of newsprint:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5018-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"plant wrapped for shipping\" class=\"wp-image-918\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5018.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5018-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5019-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-919\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5019.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5019-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Salvia pachyphylla &#8216;Blue Flame&#8217;</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is Lance&#8217;s &#8211; Salvia pachyphylla &#8216;Blue Flame&#8217; aka Giant Purple Desert Sage.  It doesn&#8217;t look giant here but the foliage smells wonderful &#8211; that classic desert sage scent.  I can&#8217;t wait to see what Lance does with it!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5020-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"plant wrapped in paper\" class=\"wp-image-920\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5020.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5020-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The taller plants had been folded over inside the paper &#8211; you can sort of see that here (I&#8217;ve unfolded this one).  There was very little breakage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5021-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"salvia plant in pot\" class=\"wp-image-921\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5021.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5021-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above pictured was the only plant that had any of its soil come out of the pot, and as you can see it was only a bit of a dusting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5023-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"unboxed mail-order plants\" class=\"wp-image-922\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5023.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5023-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5023-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The whole shipment</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here they are all unboxed.  My two are the Salvia africana-lutea &#8216;Kirstenbosch&#8217; (in front with the brown flowers) and the one directly behind it which is Salvia x jamensis &#8216;Full Moon&#8217;.  I had also ordered S. semiatrata but unfortunately it was out of stock by the time they shipped. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now here they are one day later &#8211; they&#8217;ve unfolded a bit and I have all the confidence in the world that they&#8217;ll continue to do so and in a week there will be no remaining evidence of having been folded over for shipping.  Pretty neat technique!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5072-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-923\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5072.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5072-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5072-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>boink</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In other Salvia-related news,  I&#8217;m changing up the area by the front door which involves removing (finally, phew) the gigantic &#8216;Hot Lips&#8217; as well as (at least most of) the culinary sage &#8216;Berggarten&#8217;.  Both are very successful plants there, but dangit, I want more interesting things in that highly visible area.  Honestly I&#8217;ve been sort of stuck, design-wise, in this area for a while (analysis paralysis, anyone?) but my housemate Kate got me unstuck.  Basically, she said the Hot Lips is boring and the red and white color is pretty gaudy, and the culinary sage is just an oversized blob that belongs in a less prominent spot, if we&#8217;re going to have it at all.  Despite my myriad excuses for leaving those plants (both of which came with the house) in place for so long, I knew immediately that she&#8217;s absolutely right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway stay tuned &#8211; here&#8217;s a &#8220;before&#8221; pic:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5073-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"culinary sage plant\" class=\"wp-image-924\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5073.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5073-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>So very successful.  But I&#8217;m over it.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, I&#8217;m happy to report that my S. discolor made it through the winter in its pot, protected under my patio right up against the house.   Now it&#8217;s out in the garden looking very pretty! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5074-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-925\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5074.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5074-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IMG_5074-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Salvia discolor and that&#8217;s Digitalis &#8216;Honey Trumpet&#8217; at left</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy gardening. </p>\n","date":"June 06, 2019","categories":[{"name":"Mail Order","slug":"mail-order"},{"name":"Overwintering","slug":"overwintering"}],"tags":[{"name":"Salvia","slug":"salvia"}],"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f84e82aa-012d-5014-b466-8a94c8ac4bb5"}}}
