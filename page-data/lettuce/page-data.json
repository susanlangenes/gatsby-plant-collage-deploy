Hostas, every single one of them.  This is the ridiculous horde of hostas I got at Fred Meyer last summer because they were $2 each and I apparently had $50 burning a hole in my pocket.  These will all go over to Wichita Ave, because she loves hostas, and the north side of her house just begs for a whole bed of them.  Okay I might keep one &#8216;Sum &amp; Substance&#8217; just because it&#8217;s insane and chartreuse.</p>\n<p>Other fun tasks for the day included cutting last year&#8217;s (mostly) dead stems of Gaura and no I&#8217;m not calling it Oenothera yet.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_569\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-569\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-569\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6027-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6027.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6027-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6027-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-569\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">I leave them in place as long as I can stand it because I love this</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Grassing.  There is no &#8220;weeding&#8221; in my front garden.  The only &#8220;weed&#8221; is grass.  So I grassed.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_570\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-570\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-570\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6023-e1521332231162-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6023-e1521332231162.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6023-e1521332231162-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6023-e1521332231162-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-570\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bye grass.

Sure, why not?</p>\n<p>I also took some of that mass of Angelina sedum and threw them around a bit.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_572\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-572\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-572\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6025-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6025.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6025-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6025-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-572\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">sorry bout that thumb</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>And lastly my neighbor&#8217;s Kanzan cherry is about to burst open.  I love this bud phase!</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-573\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6041-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6041.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6041-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_6041-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for today.
