It had a ton of tiny little purple baby leaves.  I was amazed, so relieved, and so happy.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the lime, a year and a half after that episode, looking wonderful:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_166\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-166\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-166\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0384-e1510035387100-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0384-e1510035387100.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_0384-e1510035387100-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-166\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Citrus hystrix, August 2015</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>So this is now (I think I hope) happening with my lemon that I just got this summer from Four Winds Growers, which is the same place I got the lime tree from maybe 10 years ago.  The lemon arrived in good shape with about 5 fruits on it.  I wasn&#8217;t thinking about what its growing conditions might have been at the nursery, so I just put it outside, middle of August, heat waves and all.  I should have hardened it off more carefully, but I didn&#8217;t even think.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the lemon on September 2, about 2 weeks after it arrived:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_167\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-167\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-167\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_13991-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_13991.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_13991-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_13991-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-167\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meyer lemon, Sept 2, 2017</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>But unfortunately it really went downhill from there.  It started to get yellow leaves, here and there at first, but then more and more.  The citrus cognoscenti highly recommend a potting mix of what they call 5-1-1.  It&#8217;s 5 parts fairly coarse bark, 1 part perlite, and 1 part peat-based regular potting soil.  I made a mix that was more like 5-1-2, because I wanted a little bit more moisture-holding capacity as my citrus plants do spend the whole frost-free season outdoors.  I repotted it into this mix, and it was still looking more or less okay when I first brought it in, albeit more chlorotic.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_168\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-168\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-168\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_21721-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_21721.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_21721-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_21721-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-168\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">October 10, 2017, right about when I brought them in</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>In the pic above, see that little poof of new leaves over on the right side of the lemon?

And yes that&#8217;s an ant trap in the pot in the background.  And a scale insect on the lemon, which I only noticed after looking at this picture; that got removed along with several others.  But you guys, this little lemon is covered with tiny leafy bits like this.  Some seem like they might be flowers which I&#8217;m not thrilled about, but whatever.</p>\n<p>I am very hopeful but also still prepared for disappointment if we have to go that way.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, there are other cool things happening in the indoor grow room.  The pepper I brought in is really thriving and keeps making fruit.
