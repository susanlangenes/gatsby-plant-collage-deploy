I&#8217;ll confess that before we got there, I expected that I wouldn&#8217;t be all that interested in a bunch of southern California plants that I can&#8217;t grow.  I was dead wrong about that, as you will see.</p>\n<p>The first thing I want to show you is that this really is a desert. The Coachella Valley is where dates are grown, but truth be told the only farms I saw were wind farms. What you&#8217;re seeing from the plane here is the incredibly stark difference between the natural landscape and the irrigated golf-resort-type places that are everywhere around Palm Springs.  It reminds me very much of the Phoenix area, where I lived for a few insanity-inducing months in I think 1999.  I couldn&#8217;t stand to witness this kind of resource usage.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-336\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45671-e1518221414874-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45671-e1518221414874.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45671-e1518221414874-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this post I&#8217;m going to show you some of the plants I found around town in an attempt to show what gardening is like here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the first plants I saw that I freaked about was this Cercis occidentalis.  The flowers and leaves are bigger in real life than pictures online would have one think.  Just beautiful. I&#8217;m guessing a particularly mild winter has allowed them to keep their leaves but in a colder winter here, or certainly a colder climate, they&#8217;re fully deciduous, and likely bloom a bit later.  This is a crappy zoomed-in iPhone picture, but still.  The largest leaves here are as big as your hand.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-340\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45731-e1518224293823-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45731-e1518224293823.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_45731-e1518224293823-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-341\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_49791-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_49791.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_49791-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_49791-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>Oh.  It was impossibly sunny, of course, the whole time so will just have to contend with that for this tour.</p>\n<p>Except these next two plants.  This was just after sundown.  Of course I gravitated toward this silvery thing the minute I saw it but then I realized, it&#8217;s everywhere.  People here are probably sick of it.  I love it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-342 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4577-e1518226821967-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4577-e1518226821967.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4577-e1518226821967-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>The leaves have a dense, soft indumentum and they&#8217;re a little thick.  Encelia farinosa, brittlebush.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-343\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4576-e1518227114440-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4576-e1518227114440.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4576-e1518227114440-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next up is this beauty which I had a rough time photographing.  These are just roadside plants, so far.  I love love love this color scheme.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-344 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4579-e1518229744501-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4579-e1518229744501.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4579-e1518229744501-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>What is it?

The tall sticks are ocotillo, and the octopus with the hot pink flowers is, I think, some kind of curious Bouganvillea.  Nice to see some non-butchered olives, although these may well have been pollarded at some point (just not recently).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-350\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4625-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4625.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4625-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IMG_4625-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This next garden is much more to my liking.

That gardens here are a mix of native/xeriscape and not-native/non-xeriscape.  But if you take the lawns out of the equation, there are very few drought-intolerant plants. People seem to understand that is IS actually a desert.  Except for the lawns, which are clearly one of the most pervasive and indelible obsessions in the American landscape.</p>\n<p>I discovered Opuntia!  I&#8217;ve noticed them before, but I&#8217;ve never been particularly interested.  Now they have my attention! You&#8217;ll see a LOT more of them in upcoming posts.</p>\n<p>I realized I no longer hate palm trees.  I had such a bad trip living in Phoenix all those years ago and I associated palms &#8211; specifically Washingtonia &#8211; with that time and with these places I couldn&#8217;t stand to be.  But I&#8217;m over that and can certainly recognize that my psychosis isn&#8217;t the palms&#8217; fault.  Now I can love them.  They&#8217;re like landscape exclamation points.  Or Greek columns.  Or fireworks.  Nah, not fireworks, I hate fireworks.  I never thought I&#8217;d say this but I actually wouldn&#8217;t mind having a palm or two in the garden.  Chamaerops humilis var. cerifera is on my list.</p>\n<p>Overall plant diversity in cultivated landscapes and gardens seems low to me here.  I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s accurate, or if that&#8217;s just the impression I got.  Despite that, this is a very colorful place and I love that aspect of it.</p>\n<p>Ok, that&#8217;s it for the sidewalk tour.  Stay tuned for <a href=\"https://plant-collage.com/2018/02/palm-springs-part-2-3/\">Part 2</a>, the weird and wonderful Moorten Botanical Garden, and then Part 3 will be a trip to Joshua Tree National Park.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"February 10, 2018","categories":[{"name":"California","slug":"california"},{"name":"Other Gardens","slug":"other-gardens"},{"name":"Succulents","slug":"succulents"}],"tags":null,"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2bd5d4b6-d688-5066-96ce-5a6ba5274eb3"}}}
