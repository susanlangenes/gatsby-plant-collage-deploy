HA! Did I? Actually, admittedly, I did.</p>\n<p>Turns out, other plans were in store!</p>\n<p>Ok here&#8217;s the best pic I can come up with:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_551\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-551\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-551\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58681-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58681.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58681-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58681-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-551\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">this looks better than it is</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>So the success rate on the grafts is exactly 50%.  LAME.</p>\n<p>What happened, you ask? I&#8217;ll tell you.  The rootstocks failed in that they experienced damping off.  I am nearly certain this was due to me leaving the dome cover on for too long.  Really high humidity and also high temps = they mushed.  The fact that the rootstock stem diameter was generally around 75-80% of the scion stem diameter didn&#8217;t help; they had to hold all that up and I didn&#8217;t give them stakes initially.</p>\n<p>But, whatever, this is why I started and grafted more than I really need.</p>\n<p>I started this post on March 8, so two days ago.  It&#8217;s now the 10th and things are actually looking even better.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_553\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-553\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-553\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59291-e1520744391526-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59291-e1520744391526.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59291-e1520744391526-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-553\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">there are 9 successfully grafted plants here</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Some of the graft attempts failed completely in that the rootstock rotted and the scion also died. But with some of them, the scions made adventitious roots more or less at the graft point, so where those rootstocks died, I took the scions back off and stuck them in the medium; they&#8217;ll re-grow more roots and make it just fine.  These plants are quite flexible.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_554\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-554\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-554\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58611-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58611.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58611-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58611-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-554\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">successful grafts!</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the above photo you can see three successful grafts, and the one shorter plant over on the right in back? That&#8217;s a scion whose rootstock died, but it made roots anyway and now it&#8217;s going fine after being re-inserted into the cell.</p>\n<p>So here they are: 9 successful grafts, and another handful of scions that lost their rootstocks.  They all look pretty good at this point I think.  The tall ones here are the successful grafts and the shorties are the scions I re-stuck.  I realize it&#8217;s hard to tell who is tall and who is short; you have to just trust me on this.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-562\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58631-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58631.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58631-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58631-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>In other news, I went ahead and up-potted the remaining tomatoes that are own-root non-graft virgins; a total of 8 plants and one of them is a rootstock which I&#8217;ll grow out because science (it&#8217;s actually the smallest one in lower right):</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-556\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59281-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59281.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59281-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_59281-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And, the peppers!!

We&#8217;re earlier than last year.  Here they are:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_558\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-558\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-558\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58701-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58701.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58701-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_58701-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-558\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Super hot peppers: Carolina Reapers, Chocolate Bhutlah, and a Trinidad Douglah x Trinidad Scorpion hybrid.  Very quick germination this year as opposed to last.
