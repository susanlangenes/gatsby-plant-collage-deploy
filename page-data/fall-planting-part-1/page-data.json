The first year, the focus was on establishing vegetable gardening beds.  The second year, we did a little more of that, and started the process of eliminating lawn.  Now we have a total of 11 rectangular vegetable beds (4&#8242; x 10&#8242;) which are edged with cedar to keep the clover and creepy grass out.  This year the focus is ornamental plants.</p>\n<p>When we first moved here, I had &#8220;food forest&#8221; ideas &#8211; for a time, we wanted every single plant to produce something edible.  My, how experience changes things! After living in an apartment building for 10 years with only a tiny garden space, we were delusional in our enthusiasm.  It&#8217;s not that we can&#8217;t eat all the things that come out of the garden, it&#8217;s that we run out of time to prepare and preserve.</p>\n<p>Besides, I want to grow cool stuff. So here are a few of the plants that went in the ground today, all front yard.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_114\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-114\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-114 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25011-e1509141831775-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25011-e1509141831775.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25011-e1509141831775-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cupressus glabra ‘Sulphurea’ &#8211; sooo excited to find this at Xera Plants the other day</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>The idea with the cypress here is to be a color/form contrast to the Japanese maple, which wants to be a blob. This spot was begging me for something light-colored and upright in form.  I tried a Lomatia myricoides first, but it died quickly because I planted it into some imported soil that turned out to be really high in every nutrient &#8211; Lomatia, like all members of the family Proteaceae, can&#8217;t tolerate excessive phosphorus in the soil.  Hopefully the cypress will enjoy it (and, it&#8217;s next to that soil but not exactly in it).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve known for a while that Proteaceae members don&#8217;t like extra phosphorus, and presumed this is simply because Australian soils tend to be very low in it.  I came across a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262306045_Cluster_roots_of_south-western_Australian_and_Chilean_Proteaceae_a_curiosity_in_context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very interesting publication</a> that detailed what is actually going on.  Rather than try to distill it, I&#8217;ll quote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many Proteaceae, including Banksia and Hakea species, but not Embothrium coccineum , are readily killed by phosphorus fertilisation; they are highly sensitive to slightly enhanced soil phosphorus levels. They tend to accumulate phosphorus in their leaves, to concentrations that would be severely toxic to any plant (typically ≥ 1% of the dry mass). However, other plants rarely achieve such high concentrations in their leaves, even when heavily fertilised with phosphorus. That is because most plants reduce their phosphorus-uptake capacity when supplied with high phosphorus concentrations in the soil or nutrient solution. They close the doors through which phosphorus enters the roots when a big crowd of phosphorus molecules is waiting to move in. We discovered that the extreme sensitivity of H. prostrata and other Proteaceae is due to a very low capacity to reduce their phosphorus-uptake systems when elevated phosphorus levels are present in the soil. Some time, during the course of millions of years of evolution on severely phosphorus-impoverished soils, for many Proteaceae this trait disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Right right, millions of years.  Not gonna undo that, now are we? But wait, there&#8217;s more:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having discovered the physiological cause of the phosphorus sensitivity of some Proteaceae, we made a wider survey of related species. Interestingly, some plants that are closely related to hakeas, e.g. , Grevillea crithmifolia , also belonging to the Proteaceae, do not suffer from phosphorus toxicity, even when exposed to phosphorus levels that are much higher than those that kill some Hakea or Banksia species. This grevillea closes its doors through which phosphorus moves in when supplied with a lot of phosphorus. We have also discovered that these traits apply to various species of South African Proteaceae. Relatively P-insensitive Proteaceae species are typically associated with soils that contain more plan-available phosphorus, e.g. , those derived from more nutrient-rich parent material. The sheer diversity of traits adopted by various Proteaceae from Australia, South America and South Africa offers enormous potential for breeders who are keen to develop new cultivars in the Proteaceae. It should not be too difficult to cross phosphorus insensitivity into new cultivars, which could then be grown without the risk of phosphorus poisoning in our gardens.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well how do you like that? So now all we need to do is find Proteaceae species that have this door-closing ability that are also <em>cold-tolerant</em>, and breed away.  Great! I&#8217;m on it! Just kidding.  Anyway I thought it was interesting, and it does give me some hope that someone someday will come up with a P-tolerant river lomatia.</p>\n<p>A couple of manzanitas:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_116\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-116\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-116 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25051-e1509143165569-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-116\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arctostaphylos mewukka ‘Motley Crue’, from Cistus Nursery.

Anyway when you spread roots out like a fan, generally they&#8217;ll need a stake for a while.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_117\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-117\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-117\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25101-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25101.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25101-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25101-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-117\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amsonia ciliata &#8216;Halfway to Arkansas&#8217; , from <a href=\"http://www.pomariusnursery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomarius Nursery</a></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>This is out front by the street, an area which is supposed to be a no-summer-water zone.  I&#8217;m curious to see how this Amsonia handles it.  The plant with green leaves on the left is indeed a calla, one with shockingly black flowers that came with the house, and it does quite well, believe it or not.  I&#8217;ll move the Amsonia if I have to, I just liked this texture for this spot.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_118\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-118\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-118 size-large\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25031-e1509143681478-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25031-e1509143681478.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_25031-e1509143681478-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-118\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Helichrysum tianshanicum, from Xera</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Have you ever bought a plant and almost immediately realized you should have bought three of them?
