I don&#8217;t know how I would EVER get anything done around here if I didn&#8217;t have ducks to help me with planting.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>Then I just decided to go for it.  Why the hell not?  With two exceptions I planted one grafted and one not-grafted specimen (heh) of each variety.  San Marzano got one extra grafted plant.  And I only planted one (not grafted) Sungold because omg you only need one.  For your whole block!</p>\n<p>So here we are, right on time.  It *feels* really early to be putting tomatoes out but I always do it at the end of April.  So maybe it&#8217;s a week earlier than normal?  This is definitely the shortest-ever hardening-off period.  Two days.  I attribute that to two things: 1) they&#8217;ve been in the garage where night temps have been getting regularly into the low 50&#8217;s since I took the light off 24-hour and let the timer turn it off at night (it&#8217;s been about 2 weeks of that) and 2) they didn&#8217;t really get sunburn yesterday.  Must be the brightness of that T-5? I have the citrus out in direct sun as well, and they&#8217;re not burning either after life under T-5 all winter.</p>\n<p>I do use wood chips in my vegetable garden, I know, isn&#8217;t that weird? No one does that.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-639\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67491-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67491.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67491-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67491-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>The above pic illustrates how I deal with the wood chips.  The trowel marks the spot where I&#8217;m going to dig a hole for the plant.  The big cleared-off bare soil area is where I&#8217;m going to put the pile of soil from the hole.  Once the plant is in then I put the wood chips back over wherever there is bare soil.  Some people don&#8217;t like wood chips in vegetable beds because they don&#8217;t like having to move chips around to plant things, or they don&#8217;t like it when the chips inevitably mix with the soil, or whatever.  I don&#8217;t care about any of that because the chips are the best mulch I&#8217;ve ever found for vegetables.  The trickiest thing is when I have to pull a big plant up by the roots &#8211; that can certainly make chips and soil mix together more than I want.   But I just do it carefully and actually, most of the time I just cut the plant at soil level and leave the roots in place (really big cabbages may be an exception).</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_640\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-640\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-640\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67531-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67531.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67531-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67531-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-640\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">All done for now.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>See how kind of dark and curled and hard those plants look? You can&#8217;t tell from the photo but these plants are STIFF.  This is all just because I changed everything up a lot this year in the indoor seed-starting area and I&#8217;m still getting the hang of it.  Different lights, different container medium, different fertilizer, and on top of that grafting tomatoes.  Talk about unscientific experiments!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the scraggly band of remaining tomato plants &#8211; and this is not all of them.  The spindly one with the yellow leaves is a rootstock plant.  I just want to see what that&#8217;s like so I&#8217;m going to let it flower and fruit for the hell of it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-641\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67511-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67511.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67511-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IMG_67511-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>And in addition to that I have about 8 more inside, which I&#8217;m only *just* starting to harden off &#8211; they are very soft plants so the hardening off needs to be really careful.   Of these remaining plants, 4 will go to Carol on Wichita Ave, 8 will go to my sister and hopefully the rest will find homes somewhere.</p>\n<p>We have some exceptional weather coming up so I&#8217;m going to try to get as many plants in the ground as possible this weekend.  Wish me luck!</p>\n","date":"April 21, 2018","categories":[{"name":"Edibles","slug":"edibles"}],"tags":[{"name":"tomatoes","slug":"tomatoes"}],"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"222432ee-13b6-57f5-b3cd-81b936546f43"}}}
