Well, if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, let me tell you about this absolutely wonderful western native plant.  Bullet points for you speed-readers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&#8217;t get those damned fruit flies (<a href=\"http://spottedwing.org/\">spotted-wing drosophila</a>)</li>\n<li>Fruits start ripening in early June and continue well into July</li>\n<li>Fruits on old wood (floricane-fruiting)</li>\n<li>Thorns are recurved, so they grab you a bit, not horribly</li>\n<li>Gorgeous white bark, really cool looking in winter</li>\n<li>Spreads by tip-layering, not by runners</li>\n<li>Supremely climate-adapted and needs no supplemental water, ever</li>\n<li>Vigorous to the point of OMGWTF if you don&#8217;t watch it</li>\n<li>Fruit flavor is less tart. less bright, more complex, maybe sweeter? And they&#8217;re a bit seedier which I don&#8217;t mind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what I do, is I treat the thing just like a normal raspberry, except for the tip-layering bit (do not permit unless someone wants a plant).  And the watering (none).  When the floricanes are done, I&#8217;ll cut them out at ground level, and at the same time I&#8217;ll prune the primocanes back by about half &#8211; if I don&#8217;t do that they will eat things like my neighbor&#8217;s house, and pruning them encourages them to branch a lot, so then I get a more compact-shrubby plant instead of a 20&#8242; long bramble.  Like any raspberry you absolutely cannot leave this plant alone and expect it to behave.  But aside from that, in my book it scores well above normal raspberries (which, as previously mentioned, are all coming out this year).</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the whole plant &#8211; see the tall primocanes with the glorious white &#8220;skin&#8221;? On left, lower, are the floricanes which looked just like these primocanes last year at this time until I shortened them by about half. I&#8217;ll have to reduce the number of them this year, too.  Eventually this plant will get some form of support structure.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_716\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-716\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-716\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80511-e1529776317793-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-716\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evidence of house-eating potential</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p>When/if these primocanes touch ground, they will root.  Right through grass and mulch and everything.  I&#8217;m helping this one so my friends Kate and Katie can have a plant.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_717\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-717\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-717\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80521-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-717\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">tip-layering, with assistance (totally unnecessary but speeds the process)</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-715\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-715\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80491-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-715\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blackcaps are delicious</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-718\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971.jpg 1024w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-300x225.jpg 300w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_80971-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember when I discovered these, as a kid, or who (Mom? probably, native Oregon kid that she is) turned me onto them.  But I do remember, every summer, going up into the woods and finding them at the edges of forests, and in clearings.  I had two particularly good patches and if I ended up encountering them unintentionally I&#8217;d have to use my shirt, or my hat, or whatever I could find (Acer macrophyllum leaf?) to hold them, because neither patch was particularly close to the house and, being a lazy-ass Taurus, I wasn&#8217;t about to actually go back and get some kind of bucket.  We made freezer jam with them whenever sis TJ and I would pick enough.  Rarely straight blackcap jam, though &#8211; the best was to mix them 50/50 with red raspberries from the garden. &#8211; that was everyone&#8217;s favorite.</p>\n<p>Freezer jam is the best because, since it&#8217;s uncooked, the flavor is much more true to the berry.  I asked Mom about her recipe and what she said is that she generally followed whatever was on the Sure-Jell pectin box.  Pectin and pectin-type products vary a bit in terms of what&#8217;s in them, and how they recommend going about it, so the things to remember are (god I love bullet points):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use a sugar substitute, or try to use less sugar than the directions call for. This will invariably lead to disappointment.  If you want to preserve fruit but not with sugar, just freeze the fruit whole and you can make a simple compote in January with the frozen berries and little to no sugar.</li>\n<li>If the recipe says to strain some or all of the fruit to reduce the seeds, it&#8217;s optional, and you should experiment to see what you like.  I would definitely strain a straight blackcap jam, but I might not strain it at all (or just strain the blackcaps) if it&#8217;s half and half.</li>\n<li>Do not skimp or cut any corners with whatever the recipe says with regard to stirring and/or letting the fruit stand.  You want to make damn sure all the sugar gets dissolved completely and all the pectin does whatever it&#8217;s supposed to do.</li>\n<li>If the recipe calls for lemon juice, know that it&#8217;s not like adding lemon juice or citric acid to a low-acid fruit for shelf-stable canning.  In other words, lemon juice is mostly for flavor, and may help with the jelling process, but it&#8217;s not needed for preservation.</li>\n<li>Use whatever containers you want but again, since you&#8217;re just freezing, you don&#8217;t need actual canning jar lids and rings.  A good seal helps prevent freezer burn.  I like actual freezer jam jars with the colored plastic lids the best.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All right, now I feel weird because I&#8217;ve strayed dangerously close to the food-blog corner, so just to assure myself and you all that this is still really about plants, here&#8217;s another plant picture &#8211; The stems of R. leucodermis, as mentioned, look absolutely ghostly and really cool in winter.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-719\" src=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721.jpg 768w, https://plant-collage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_45081-e1529781512721-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","date":"June 23, 2018","categories":[{"name":"Back yard","slug":"back-yard"},{"name":"Edibles","slug":"edibles"},{"name":"Native plants","slug":"native-plants"}],"tags":[{"name":"Broccoli","slug":"broccoli"},{"name":"cabbage","slug":"cabbage"},{"name":"eggplants","slug":"eggplants"},{"name":"leeks","slug":"leeks"},{"name":"lettuce","slug":"lettuce"},{"name":"melons","slug":"melons"},{"name":"peppers","slug":"peppers"},{"name":"Rubus","slug":"rubus"},{"name":"tomatoes","slug":"tomatoes"}],"author":{"name":"susan","slug":"susan"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"797ae2dd-6d67-5a26-a48f-1a71d0ca4480"}}}
